# JAVASCRIPT AND THE DOM
## JavaScript with HTML and CSS
At the beginning of this course we mentioned that JavaScript is the most widely used language on the web. So how can we use JavaScript on a website?

So far, we've only used JavaScript in isolation â€“ not alongside other technologies. Javascript typically gets included with HTML and CSS (which structure and style web pages). All modern browsers know how to run JavaScript if we include it in an HTML and CSS project.

JavaScript also has some special functions to help us access the code inside HTML and CSS so that we can write JavaScript to make that output interactive and dynamic.

In this lesson, we will use the concepts we've learned throughout the course to make an HTML and CSS website dynamic.

Instructions
If you're unfamiliar with HTML and CSS, you can follow along with this lesson regardless. If you'd like to get a primer before continuing, try our HTML and CSS course here.

## Linking JavaScript
We can link a JavaScript file to HTML by including it as the src of a <script> tag inside of an HTML file, like this:

<script src='js/main.js'></script>
This line of code will link the file located at js/main.js. You can find this file in the file navigator by clicking the file button located at the top left of the code editor. Within the navigator, there's a folder named js, and within that folder is the main.js file.

By linking js/main.js in the index.html file, we are asking the browser to run our JavaScript code each time index.html loads.

We've provided you with a sample website (and the corresponding HTML and CSS code). Our goal: use JavaScript to make this page more dynamic. We will add interactive features to it as we go through the lesson.

In the code editor, we've loaded the files for a static HTML and CSS website. If you've never seen HTML before, don't worry, we'll walk through how JavaScript is added to an existing HTML and CSS project in this lesson. This lesson won't require you to greatly modify the HTML and CSS code itself. (For a deeper dive, see our HTML & CSS course here.)

1.
Let's start by writing some JavaScript that we will soon link to our HTML document.

Click the folder icon attached to the code editor, and navigate inside the js folder and open main.js.

Inside main.js, write:

alert('Hello JavaScript!');
Note: alert is a JavaScript function that will create a pop-up window with text inside it. When we link the main.js file to the HTML file, we will see a pop-up window that was generated by this code. alert is not used by JavaScript developers in practice, however it is useful here to demonstrate linking these two files. We will use it over the next few exercises for demonstration purposes.

2.
Navigate back to index.html. Before the closing </body> tag, create a link to the main.js file using a <script> tag.

Once you've add it, click 'Run'.


3.
Nice alert pop-up! We just connected JavaScript to an HTML file. When the HTML document loaded, it ran the code inside main.js, which created the alert pop-up.

Now let's take this a step further.


## Document Object Model
The Document Object Model, commonly referred to as the DOM', is the term for elements in an HTML file. Elements are any HTML code denoted by HTML tags, like <div>, <a>, or <p>. Let's use JavaScript to interact with the DOM.

We can select an HTML element with JavaScript by selecting its class attribute, like this:

var header = document.getElementsByClassName('example-class-name');
This would find an element like this in the HTML:

<div class='example-class-name'> ... </div>
Instructions
1.
Let's see how JavaScript can select an HTML element.

Inside index.html, notice there's an <div> element with a class of skillset on line 10. Let's select this element with JavaScript.

Click on the folder icon to navigate to js/main.js.

Inside main.js, delete the alert you wrote in the last exercise. Then, create a variable named skillset and set it equal to the HTML element with the class skillset.

2.
Under the skillset variable, use an alert to make the skillset variable's value into a pop-up.

3.
Way to go! The pop up showed that you selected an [object HTMLCollection].

This confirms that JavaScript can select HTML elements. Since we can select HTML elements, we can manipulate them.

Selecting and modifying HTML elements with plain JavaScript can be tricky. Luckily, there's an easier way. Click 'Next' to learn more.

## jQuery
We've just covered how to select HTML elements using the syntax: document.getElementsByClassName. This is verbose and clunky, however. If we were to select a lot of elements this way, our code would get dense and difficult to read.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a simpler way to select DOM elements? As you might have guessed, there is!

To better interact with DOM elements, we can use a library. A library is a set of code that contains useful pre-written functions that help with certain tasks.

A great library for interacting with the DOM is jQuery.

jQuery is a library written in JavaScript. The syntax and functions it contains will help us interact with DOM efficiently. We'll walk through a few examples in the following exercises.

In order to use jQuery, we need to:

Include jQuery in our project. jQuery is a library, which means it is a set of code in a file, therefore we will need to link that file in our HTML in order to access it.

Once we link it in our HTML file, we can use its functions and syntax in our js/main.js file.

Once linked, we'll need to make sure our HTML is loaded before we run our jQuery and JavaScript code.

This will prevent our jQuery and JavaScript code from running before the elements they select are rendered.

1.
Since jQuery is a library of code, we need to include a link to it in our index.html file before we can use it. Before the closing </body> tag, right above your current <script> tag, include this code:

<script src='https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js'></script>
The link to jQuery needs to be above the link to the js/main.js file, which will give main.js access to the jQuery library.

Note: If you're curious, you can see all the code that makes up jQuery here. You'll notice that jQuery is just JavaScript!

2.
Now that we've included jQuery, let's get it ready to run.

Navigate to js/main.js.

Delete or comment out your existing code in js/main.js. Then, write a function named main. The function should take no parameters and should have an empty block.


3.
jQuery has a built in function to check if the page is ready before it will run our code. After the main function, write this code:

$(document).ready(main);
Notice that we put main inside the parentheses of ready. main here is a callback, which means that our code will wait until the document (in other words, the DOM) is loaded, or ready. When it is, then it will execute the main function. jQuery calls back to the main function, therefore it's a callback.

In the event that our HTML and CSS took 5 minutes to load, this code would wait until it loaded completely before running

4.
Nice work! We are now ready to start using jQuery. Let's try in the next exercise.

## jQuery Selectors
With plain JavaScript we selected an HTML element with this code:

document.getElementsByClassName('skillset');
With jQuery we can select the same element with:

$('.skillset');
We can wrap any CSS selector, like class, id, or tag, with $('.example-class') to select it with jQuery.

The selectors jQuery uses are the exact same as CSS selectors. For instance, if there's an element with a class of supporting-text, you could select it with $('.supporting-text'). Another example, if an element had an id of 'header', you could select it with $('#header').

1.
Let's select the element with the class of skillset, but this time with jQuery.

In js/main.js, inside the main function, write a variable named $skillset. Set $skillset equal to a jQuery selector for the skillset class.

Note: It is a common convention to name variables that hold jQuery selectors with a dollar sign $.



2.
On the line below the jQuery selector for skillset, write an alert on $skillset.

3.
The alert shows [object Object]. This is right and means that we successfully selected the same HTML element as before, but this time using jQuery.

Now let's see what we can do once we've selected an DOM element.
