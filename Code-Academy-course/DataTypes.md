# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT
## Types

The building blocks of JavaScript make up every program and line of JavaScript.

Just like a language has nouns, verbs, and prepositions, JavaScript has its own building blocks. Instead of calling them building blocks, however, developers call them data types.

There are three essential data types to know for now, and here is your first test of memorization (don't worry, we will practice):

String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
Boolean: This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.
Let's review: a string is any grouping of words, a number's a number, and a boolean is a ghostly halloween costume. Or no, that's false! It's either true or false.

1.
In the code editor, there are three variables (we will learn about variables in the next lesson). For now, replace each variable's value with each corresponding type.

On line 1, there's a variable named myString equal to undefined. Replace undefined, with a string of your name.



2.
On line 2, there's a variable named myNumber, also equal to undefined. Replace undefined with your lucky number.



3.
On line 3, answer this question with a boolean:

Did you like the Halloween joke?

If so, replace the word undefined with the boolean true. Otherwise, replace undefined with false.



4.
Notice that your string, number, and boolean printed to the black box on the right. That is the console, and is a program that can run JavaScript programs and show their results.

We will learn how to use the JavaScript with the console in the next exercise.
